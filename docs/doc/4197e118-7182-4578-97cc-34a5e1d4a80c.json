Expected results can be found for two datasets below.  We may update the code significantly in the coming week.\n# Weak-to-strong generalization\n![Our setup and how it relates to superhuman AI alignment](./weak-to-strong-setup.png)\nThis project contains code for implementing our [paper on weak-to-strong generalization](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/weak-to-strong-generalization.pdf).\nThe primary codebase contains a re-implementation of our weak-to-strong learning setup for binary classification tasks.  The codebase contains code for fine-tuning pretrained language models, and also training against the labels from another language model.  We support various losses described in the paper as well, such as the confidence auxiliary loss.\nThe `vision` directory contains stand-alone code for weak-to-strong in the vision models setting (AlexNet -> DINO on ImageNet)."

The project uses `pyproject.toml` to manage dependencies. To install the dependencies, you can use a package manager like `pip`:\n```\npip install .\n```\n#### Running the Script\nThe main script of the project is train_weak_to_strong.py. It can be run from the command line using the following command:\n```\npython train_weak_to_strong.py\n```\nThe script accepts several command-line arguments to customize the training process. Here are some examples:\n```\npython train_weak_to_strong.py --batch_size 32 --max_ctx 512 --ds_name \"sciq\" --loss \"logconf\" --n_docs 1000 --n_test_docs 100 --weak_model_size \"gpt2-medium\" --strong_model_size \"gpt2-large\" --seed 42\n```\n#### Expected results\n<img src=\"notebooks/amazon_polarity_None.png\" width=\"350\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"notebooks/sciq_None.png\" width=\"350\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"notebooks/Anthropic-hh-rlhf_None.png\" width=\"350\">"
